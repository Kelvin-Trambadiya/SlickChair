- Authors should bid on topics, submissions picking topic is useless ATM
- Forms could be nicer with some javascript, such as by replacing the save buttons by ajax calls and using client side validation (probably a lot of work now, and will come for free when play/scala.js get more mature)
- Integrate external services such iThenticate and Docoloc for plagiarism detection, use an authorship database to help detecting conflicts and a pdf metadata extraction tool to help filling the submission form
